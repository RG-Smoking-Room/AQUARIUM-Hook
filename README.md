# Hook to fix Cyrillic display in multilanguage version of NeXAS engine

Tested games:

[Aquarium.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2515070)

[Okayu Nyumu!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3625380)

Since the hook is universal, it is assumed that it will also work with future games with multiple languages released on Steam.

Compile using VS2022.
